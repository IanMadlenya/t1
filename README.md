Background / Philosophy
-----------------------
Asset Managers want more time to focus on making money and less time on Technology and Fund Administration.

The T1 Multi Asset System solves for this
- T1 is a single product for:
  Portfolio Modelling, Trading, Attribution, Allocation, Settlement, Fund Accounting, NAV Statements, and Tax Accounting.
  
- T1 is Multi-Region / Multi-Asset Class.

- T1 can be run without IT and without Fund Administration.

- T1 leverages off the fact that almost all transactions today are electronic; 
   And that avoiding human intervention takes away human-error.
