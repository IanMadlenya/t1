T1
==

Open Source Order Management System using Bloomberg EMSX API
------------------------------------------------------------

Background / Philosophy
-----------------------
Asset Managers want more time to focus on making money and less time on Technology and Fund Administration.

The T1 Multi Asset System solves for this
- T1 is a single product for:
  Portfolio Modelling, Trading, Attribution, Allocation, Settlement, Fund Accounting, NAV Statements, and Tax Accounting.
  
- T1 is Multi-Region / Multi-Asset Class.

- T1 can be run without IT and without Fund Administration.

- T1 leverages off the fact that almost all transactions today are electronic; 
   And that avoiding human intervention takes away human-error.


Note for Developers
-------------------
The T1 system works on an Exception Basis with easy to follow maintenance. This is opposite to existing platforms.

It is easy to write software so that the Asset Manager has to hire more dedicated staff.

Please be cognisant of this fact when adding software and design for systematic and not user processing.
